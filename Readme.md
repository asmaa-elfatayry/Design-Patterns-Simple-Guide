## Patterns Covered

### 1️⃣ Creational Patterns

- [**Singleton**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/CreationalPatterns/Singleton) – One instance, global access. 

- [**Factory**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/CreationalPatterns/Factory) – Create objects without exposing instantiation logic.  

- [**Builder**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/CreationalPatterns/Builder) – Construct complex objects step by step, separating construction from the final product.

- [**Abstract Factory**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/CreationalPatterns/Abstract%20Factory) – Provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- [**Prototype**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/CreationalPatterns/Prototype) – Create new objects by **cloning existing ones**, avoiding expensive initialization and enabling flexible object creation.

   
### 2️⃣ Structural Patterns

- [**Adapter**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/StructuralPatterns/Adapter) - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object with a compatible interface. 

- [**Decorator**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/StructuralPatterns/Decorator) - Allows you to add new behavior to an object dynamically without changing its original code.  

- [**Facade**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/StructuralPatterns/Facade) – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding internal complexity from the client.

- [**Proxy**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/StructuralPatterns/Proxy) – Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to **control access**, add extra behavior without changing the real object.

- [**Bridge**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/StructuralPatterns/Bridge) – Separates an **abstraction** from its **implementation**, allowing both to vary independently, improving flexibility and extensibility.



### 3️⃣ Behavioral Patterns

- [**Observer**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/BehavioralPatterns/Observer) – Subject notifies observers automatically when its state changes.

- [**Strategy**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/BehavioralPatterns/Strategy) – Allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by switching between different algorithms (strategies).

- [**State**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/BehavioralPatterns/State) – Allows an object to change its behavior automatically when its internal state changes, without using complex conditional statements.

- [**Command**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/BehavioralPatterns/Command) – Encapsulates a request/action as an object, decoupling the sender from the executor.

- [**Mediator**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/BehavioralPatterns/Mediator)  – Centralizes communication between objects, allowing interaction without knowing each other’s internal details.


- [**Null Object**](https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/Design-Patterns-Simple-Guide/tree/main/BehavioralPatterns/NullObjectPattern) – Default object with “do nothing” behavior.
