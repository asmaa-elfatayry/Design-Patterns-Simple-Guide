## Patterns Covered

### 1️⃣ Creational 
- **Singleton** – One instance, global access.  
- **Factory** – Create objects without exposing instantiation logic.  

### 2️⃣ Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object with a compatible interface.  
- **Decorator**: Allows you to add new behavior to an object dynamically without changing its original code.  


### 3️⃣ Behavioral 
- **Observer 👀** – Subject notifies observers automatically when its state changes.

- **Strategy 🎯** – Allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by switching between different algorithms (strategies).

- **Command 🎮** – Encapsulates a request/action as an object, decoupling the sender from the executor.

- **Null Object ⚠** – Default object with “do nothing” behavior.
