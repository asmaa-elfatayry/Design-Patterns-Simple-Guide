# Design Patterns 🚀

## About this Repository

This repository was **created personally** as a way for me to **study and practice Design Patterns**.  
The goal is to have a **lightweight, simple reference** that I (and anyone else) can **quickly review or learn from**.  

- Everyone is welcome to **use it, modify it, or improve it**,  
  with the purpose of **learning, sharing, and teaching**.

> **Note:** The examples are written in **C#** with **Arabic & English explanations**,  
> so they are easy to follow and understand.


This repository explains **Design Patterns** using:  
- Simple **Arabic & English explanations**  
- **Real-life examples**  
- **Clean C# code**

## Patterns Covered

### 1️⃣ Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.  
- **Factory**: Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.  

### 2️⃣ Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object with a compatible interface.  

### 3️⃣ Behavioral Patterns
- **Null Object**: Provides a default object with "do nothing" behavior instead of returning `null`.
