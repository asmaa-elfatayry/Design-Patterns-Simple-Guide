## Patterns Covered

### 1️⃣ Creational 

- **Singleton** – One instance, global access. 

- **Factory** – Create objects without exposing instantiation logic.  

- **Builder** – Construct complex objects step by step, separating construction from the final product.

### 2️⃣ Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object with a compatible interface. 

- **Decorator**: Allows you to add new behavior to an object dynamically without changing its original code.  

- **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding internal complexity from the client.

- **Proxy** – Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to **control access**, add extra behavior (security, caching, lazy loading), without changing the real object.



### 3️⃣ Behavioral 

- **Observer 👀** – Subject notifies observers automatically when its state changes.

- **Strategy 🎯** – Allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by switching between different algorithms (strategies).

- **Command 🎮** – Encapsulates a request/action as an object, decoupling the sender from the executor.

- **Null Object ⚠** – Default object with “do nothing” behavior.
