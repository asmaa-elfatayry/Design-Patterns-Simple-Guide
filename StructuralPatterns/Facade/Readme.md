## 🪄 Facade Pattern

### 📌 What is Facade Pattern?

Facade Pattern is a **structural design pattern** that provides a **simplified interface** to a **complex subsystem**.

It hides the complexity of multiple classes and exposes **one unified entry point**, making the system easier to use and understand for clients.

### ⚠ Important Note

- Facade **does not change** the existing subsystems.  
- It **wraps complexity**, not removes it.  
- Client interacts with **one interface** instead of many classes.  
- Reduces coupling between client code and subsystem logic.  
- Improves **readability**, **maintainability**, and **usability** of the system.
