# Decorator Pattern ☕

## 📌 What is Decorator Pattern?

Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new behavior to an object dynamically without changing its original code.

It works by wrapping the original object with a new object (decorator) that adds the extra behavior.

## ⚠ Important Note

Decorator adds behavior dynamically via composition, not inheritance.

Each decorator wraps the same object and can be stacked to combine behaviors.

The original object remains unchanged.
