## Bridge Pattern 🏗️

### 📌 What is Bridge Pattern?

Bridge Pattern is a **structural design pattern** that separates an **abstraction** from its **implementation**, allowing both to vary independently.  
It helps you **change implementations without modifying the abstraction**, and **add new abstractions without touching existing implementations**.

### ⚠ Important Note

- Bridge separates the **Abstraction** from the **Implementation**.  
- Supports **flexibility and extensibility** without breaking existing code.  
- Encourages **composition over inheritance**.  
- Reduces **coupling** between high-level and low-level components.
