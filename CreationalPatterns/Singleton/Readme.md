# Singleton Design Pattern 👑

## Overview

The **Singleton Design Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance** during the application lifetime and provides a **global access point** to that instance.

It is commonly used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

---

## When to Use Singleton
- When you need **only one instance** of a class
- When the object represents a **shared resource**
- When creating multiple instances may cause **data inconsistency**

### Real-life Examples
- Fingerprint / Identity
- Application Settings
- Logger
- Cache Manager
