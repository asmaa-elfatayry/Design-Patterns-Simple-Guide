# Factory Design Pattern 🏭

## Overview
The **Factory Design Pattern** is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses or a factory class to decide which object to create.

The client does not need to know the exact class that will be instantiated.

---

## Simple Explanation (From Zero)
Instead of creating objects directly using `new`, we delegate the creation logic to a **Factory**.

The factory decides **which object** to create based on input parameters.

---

## Real-Life Example 🌍
A notification system can send messages in different ways:
- Email
- SMS
- Push Notification

The client only asks for a notification type.  
The factory creates the correct notification object.
