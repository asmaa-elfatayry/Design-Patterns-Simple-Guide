## Prototype Pattern 🧩

### 📌 What is Prototype Pattern?

Prototype Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that allows you to **create new objects by cloning existing ones**, instead of creating them from scratch.  
Useful when object creation is **expensive** or you need **many similar objects**.

### ⚠ Important Note

- Uses a **clone method** to duplicate objects.  
- Supports **dynamic object creation** without knowing class details.  
- Encourages **flexibility, reusability, and OOP principles**.  
- Avoids repeating complex initialization logic.
