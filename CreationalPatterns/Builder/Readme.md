## Builder Pattern 🏗️

### 📌 What is Builder Pattern?

Builder Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that allows you to **construct complex objects step by step**, separating the **construction process** from the **final product**.

It is useful when an object has **many parts or variations**, and lets you create different representations without modifying the client code.

### ⚠ Important Note

- Builder separates **construction** from **representation**.  
- Supports **fluent interface** (method chaining) for building objects.  
- Allows **different representations** of the product using the same construction process.  
- Makes code **readable, maintainable, and flexible**.  
- Encourages **composition over inheritance** for building complex objects.
