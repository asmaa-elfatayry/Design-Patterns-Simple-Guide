## Mediator Pattern 🛰️

### 📌 What is Mediator Pattern?

Mediator Pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that **centralizes communication between objects**, allowing them to interact **without knowing about each other’s internal details**.

It is useful when multiple objects need to coordinate actions but you want to **avoid direct dependencies between them**.

### ⚠ Important Note

- Mediator **centralizes control and coordination** between multiple objects.  
- Objects communicate **through the mediator only**, not directly.  
- Helps **reduce coupling** and **simplify complex interactions**.  
- Avoids excessive dependencies and scattered communication logic.  
- Can become a **single point of failure** if overused or too complex.

### 💡 Real-Life Examples

- **Air Traffic Control** – All planes coordinate via ATC (Mediator).  
- **Chat Rooms** – Users send messages through a central chat mediator.  
- **Smart Home Hub** – Devices (lights, AC, blinds) communicate through a hub.  
- **Workflow Engine** – Tasks coordinate via a central engine.
