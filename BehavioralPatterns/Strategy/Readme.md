### 📌 What is Strategy Pattern?

Strategy Pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that allows an object to **change its behavior at runtime** by switching between different **algorithms (strategies)**.

### ⚠ Important Note

- Strategy defines a **family of behaviors**.  
- Behavior can be **switched dynamically** at runtime.  
- Uses **composition over inheritance**.  
- Eliminates large `if / else` or `switch` statements.
