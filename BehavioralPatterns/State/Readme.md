## State Pattern 🧠

### 📌 What is State Pattern?

State Pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that allows an object to **change its behavior when its internal state changes**, without using large `if` or `switch` statements.  
It helps you **avoid conditional logic** and **encapsulate state-specific behavior** in separate classes.

### ⚠ Important Note

- State lets an object **alter its behavior automatically** based on its current state.  
- Each **state class handles its own behavior** and transitions.  
- Supports **Open/Closed Principle** by allowing new states without modifying existing code.  
- Encourages **composition over inheritance**.  
- Reduces **conditional logic** in the main object.
