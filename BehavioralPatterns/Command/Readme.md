## Command Pattern 🎮

### 📌 What is Command Pattern?

Command Pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that **encapsulates a request as an object**, allowing you to **decouple the sender (requester) from the receiver (executor)**.

It enables you to pass commands around, queue them, log them, or support undoable operations — all without the sender knowing the details of the execution.

### ⚠ Important Note

* Command encapsulates an **action as an object**.
* Sender can issue commands without knowing **how they are executed**.
* Supports **dynamic assignment of commands** at runtime.
* Facilitates **undo/redo and queueing** of operations.
* Promotes **composition over inheritance**.
